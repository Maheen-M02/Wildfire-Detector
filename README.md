# 🔥 Wildfire Detector (AI/ML Project)

### Detect Wildfires Using Deep Learning in Google Colab

---

## 🧠 Overview
**Wildfire Detector** is an AI-based system that detects fire and smoke from images or videos using deep learning.  
Built in **Google Colab**, it leverages computer vision models such as **YOLO** and **CNNs** to identify wildfire occurrences, enabling early alerts for disaster prevention.

---

## 🎯 Aim
To develop an AI model capable of detecting and classifying wildfire occurrences from image or video data for early warning and rapid response.

---

## 🧩 Objectives
- Train a computer vision model for fire and smoke detection.  
- Evaluate model performance and visualize predictions.  
- Implement detection on image/video samples.  
- Deploy or demonstrate inference within Colab.
